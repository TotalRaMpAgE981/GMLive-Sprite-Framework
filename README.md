# GMLive-Sprite-Framework
A simple framework to allow sprites so be created and saved at runtime.

If there are any errors when importing, find all instances of "_color" and replace with "_colour" within every file.
There was an update that seemingly disabled US spelling of some functions.

## About
This was a small project that I did a long time ago when I was starting to learn about coding. 
It uses GMLive, an online coding environment that was originally made for testing scripts typed in GameMaker Language.
I wanted to make a game but you can't import images, so I made a volitile sprite maker.

Most if not all of the basic functions for drawing and editing sprites work. I will not continue this.
